                    Hello World! My name is Ben. I graduated from the University of Central Florida with B.A. in Digital Media in the spring of 2018. I work a full time job of forty plus hours a week as the Head of eCommerce for Walmart.

                    If I'm not working you will always find me at the gym six to seven days a week. I'm currently working on hitting less than ten percent body fat (I'm around ten percent now). When I'm home, I'm usually meal prepping since I eat a lot of food throughout the day, six meals. Of course I want to continue learing and bettering myself so I'm currently enrolled in a six month coding bootcamp through the University of Central Florida. So far it has been a real joy to sink my teeth into coding again and I look forward to learning a ton over the next six months.

                    If I do find some free time, I enjoy hanging out with friends, playing basketball, video games, listening to podcasts, or watching YouTube. I However I don't have much free time, so I mostly just rest and sleep!
